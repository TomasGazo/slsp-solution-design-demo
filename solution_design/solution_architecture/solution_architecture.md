## Overview
The solution architecture follows a client-server model, with the mobile app (`Quiz_App`) as the client and a backend server (`Quiz_Microservice`) handling business logic and data operations.

Identity provider (`Authentication_Server`) serves to provide measuers both to Secure API access and User Authentication.
